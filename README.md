#  Outlook email highlighter

I find it difficult to spot new emails on the web interface for outlook.  New emails are marked by bold coloured text, but this is also the style of date titles and lots of other text on the screen.  The file [outlookEmailHighlighter.css](https://github.com/seannyD/OutlookEmailHighlighter/blob/master/outlookEmailHighlighter.css) provides some changes to the style that can be applied through [Chrome's stylebot extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en).  This causes unread emails to be highlighted:

## WARNING

This is completely untested and may cause unforeseen problems.  I don't recommend using it.


## Installation

Install [Stylebot for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en).

Login to your outlook inbox in Chrome.

I'm assuming you're using the "Orange" outlook theme (can change in Settings > Theme)

Click the stylebot icon in the menu (labelled "css") and click "open stylebot".

Click "Edit css" button at the bottom of the window that appears.

Paste the css code from [outlookEmailHighligher.css](https://github.com/seannyD/OutlookEmailHighlighter/blob/master/outlookEmailHighlighter.css) into the text box.

Click "save" and close the Stylebot window.

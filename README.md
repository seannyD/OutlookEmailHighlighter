#  Outlook email highlighter

I find it difficult to spot new emails on the web interface for outlook.  New emails are marked by bold coloured text, but this is also the style of date titles and lots of other text on the screen.  The file [outlookEmailHighlighter.css](https://github.com/seannyD/OutlookEmailHighlighter/blob/master/outlookEmailHighlighter.css) provides some changes to the style that can be applied through [Chrome's stylebot extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en).  This causes unread emails to be highlighted:
